# Simple Notes

A note taking app

# Plan
* Write in markdown, app will have it's markdown renderer (Bonus point: LaTeX renderer)
* Next.js frontend
* Express.js backend
* No database, notes are stored as files. Maybe a json file to handle title, tags, and other things

# Aesthetic Goal

Old windows, style UI
