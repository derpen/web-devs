# Stuffs to Add ---------------------------------------

- Upload should say filename and have preview of it after uploading something, and add option to cancel

- Rate limit
- Authoritization

# Repair ---------------------------------------

- Duplicate broke, something seems to be undefined

ERROR (payload): TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'studies_pkey')

ERROR (payload): Error uploading file
    err: {
      "type": "TypeError",
      "message": "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'file')",
      "stack":
          TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'file')

- Filter need to be fixed (maybe reset the document when new fakultas is chosen, also check to make 
sure the relation is correct before saving)
